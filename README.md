This is a module full of tools to analyse the outputs of [InterStellarGadget](https://github.com/JBorrow/InterStellarGadget), and was used for my MPhys project.
The thesis for that project is available [here](https://github.com/JBorrow/MPhysThesis).

You can run ```common.py``` in a directory full of GADGET snapshot files and it should produce some nice movies and plots.
Please see the file itself for more information.

```tests.py``` uses the included test data to produce some nice plots, take a look at it -- it should help you understand the way that the module is structured.
